# Welcome to Me!

- I use javascript/typescript a lot, but I'd prefer if more languages were web-viable.
> Waiting on WebAssembly to finally be usable.

- My text editor of choice is [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/).
> It's a neovim alternative with actually sensible keybinds.

- I develop stuff I think is hard and interesting.
> It's also a learning experience building stuff from the ground up.
