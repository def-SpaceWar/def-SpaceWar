# Welcome to Me!

- Open Source is a blessing.
- I use Gentoo.
- I use javascript/typescript a lot, but I'd be happy if more languages were web-viable.
- Functional programming rocks when you get it.
- I like making and porting themes I like. (Currently I don't port themes anymore, only make)
- I use Kakoune!
